# Tachyons-Haru

[Tachyons](http://tachyons.io/) is a wonderfully conceived CSS framework. At a time when monolithic CSS libraries like Bootstrap were king, Tachyons was a refreshing change, as its suite of lightweight, single-purpose utility classes were highly versatile, easy to use and debug.

With the first commit being made by Maine native Adam Morse (aka mrmrs) [Jan 18, 2014](https://github.com/tachyons-css/tachyons/commits?after=139156c724f8b3e4155ca75d8e353a172c541c36+1170) the project evolved at a significant pace for several years, and gained wide popularity. Over the intervening years development of Tachyons has slowed as other frameworks rose in prominence.

Tachyons-Haru's chief purpose is as a learning tool to analyse and consider the many design decisions and compromises made when crafting the original framework.

Tachyons-Haru endeavours to refresh some aspects of the project; principally, it minimises tooling around the framework with a Sass-first approach. Secondly, it aims to extend the project by adding modules and features that now have wide browser support, while removing support for unsupported browsers such as IE5-6-7.

Tachyons-Haru is a fork of Tachyons, and is unaffiliated with the parent project.
