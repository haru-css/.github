# Tachyons-Haru üçÉ

[Tachyons](http://tachyons.io/) is a wonderfully conceived CSS framework. At a time when monolithic CSS libraries like Bootstrap were king, Tachyons was a refreshing change, as its suite of lightweight, single-purpose utility classes were highly versatile, easy to use and debug.

With the first commit made by Maine native Adam Morse (aka mrmrs) on [Jan 18, 2014](https://github.com/tachyons-css/tachyons/commits?after=139156c724f8b3e4155ca75d8e353a172c541c36+1170) the project evolved at a significant pace for several years and gained wide popularity. Over the intervening years development of Tachyons tapered off, and other frameworks have risen in prominence.

In building Tachyons-Haru, my chief aim has been to analyse and consider the many design decisions and compromises that the Tachyons team made when crafting the original framework.

While compiled Tachyons is still very useable, much of the tooling around its ecosystem has suffered from breaking dependencies which prevent new builds. Tachyons-Haru aims to minimise this complexity with a monolithic Sass-first approach. Once a flexible and modern foundation has been crafted, new modules can be added to address browser features available since Tachyons' last stable release.
